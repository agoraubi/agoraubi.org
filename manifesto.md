# AGORA Protocol - Manifesto
## Money for Economic Freedom: Breaking the Chains of Centralized Control

**Version 2.0 (Dual-Program Architecture)**  
**November 2025**

---

## Abstract

**AGORA Protocol is a tool for economic freedom.**

This is money that is not tied to fiat currencies. Not dependent on exchanges. Not controlled by central institutions that manipulate it for their benefit.

This is money created directly by people, for people, outside the grasp of those who have monopolized wealth creation.

**AGORA is Bitcoin's philosophy applied to Universal Basic Income.**

## 1. The Problem: Centralized Money Creation

### The System is Broken

Money today is created centrally - by those who already have too much of it.

**The wealthy control:**
- Central banks that print money at will
- Commercial banks that create money through lending
- Investment funds that manipulate markets
- Corporations that lobby for favorable policies

**The result:**
- Money flows **upward** to asset owners
- Real wages **stagnate** for workers
- Housing becomes **unaffordable**
- Financial security becomes a **privilege**, not a right

### The Illusion of Trickle-Down

We're told to be grateful for "crumbs" - minimum wage increases, welfare programs, stimulus checks.

Meanwhile, those at the top:
- Buy more properties
- Accumulate more stocks
- Increase their political influence
- Use their wealth to extract more wealth

**This must end.**

### Why Traditional Solutions Fail

**Government welfare:**
- Bureaucratic and degrading
- Conditional and controlling
- Subject to political whims
- Often cut during economic crises (when most needed)

**Charity:**
- Insufficient and unpredictable
- Creates dependency
- Doesn't address systemic issues
- Allows the wealthy to control narratives

**Job market:**
- Automation replaces human labor
- Wages don't match productivity gains
- "Full employment" often means multiple jobs to survive
- Power imbalance favors employers

**We need a different approach.**

## 2. Why Bitcoin's Solution Isn't Enough

### Bitcoin's Revolutionary Insight

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto solved the fundamental problem of digital money:

> *"What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust."*

Bitcoin showed that **money doesn't need central banks.**

**Bitcoin's achievements:**
- Decentralized creation
- Fixed supply (21M cap)
- Censorship-resistant
- Trustless verification
- Borderless transfers

### But Bitcoin Has Limitations

**1. Centralization Through Wealth**

The more money you have, the more:
- Mining equipment you can buy
- Hash power you control
- Bitcoin you can accumulate
- Influence you wield

**Result:** Bitcoin mining is dominated by large corporations. The dream of "one CPU, one vote" is dead.

**2. Tied to Fiat System**

To get Bitcoin, most people must:
- Buy it with fiat currency
- Through centralized exchanges
- Subject to KYC/AML regulations
- At prices determined by speculative trading

**Result:** Bitcoin remains **entangled with the very system it sought to replace.**

**3. Speculation Over Usage**

Bitcoin's "store of value" narrative:
- Encourages hoarding, not spending
- Creates volatile price swings
- Makes it impractical as daily currency
- Benefits early adopters at expense of latecomers

**Result:** Bitcoin became digital gold - an investment vehicle, not a medium of exchange.

### The Core Problem

**You can't escape fiat by using fiat to enter crypto.**

As long as access requires existing wealth:
- The wealth gap persists
- Central institutions maintain control
- Economic freedom remains elusive
- Power structures don't change

**We need money that's accessible to everyone, regardless of current wealth.**

---

## 3. AGORA Solution: The Core Mechanism

### The Simple Version (Hook)

Every verified human receives **100 AGORA tokens per day**.

**Plus: Join early and get up to 1 year of back-payment instantly.**

- No mining equipment needed
- No capital investment required
- No exchanges to navigate
- No speculation necessary

**Just proof that you're a unique human being.**

### How It Works

**Step 1: Verify Your Humanity**

AGORA uses **Solana Attestation Service (SAS)** with **Civic** as the trusted identity provider:

1. **Connect your Solana wallet** (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack)
2. **Get a Civic Pass** - video selfie + ID document verification
3. **Receive SAS attestation** - on-chain proof of your identity
4. **Register with AGORA** - your attestation is verified, account created

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- Personal data stays off-chain (with Civic)
- Only attestation reference stored on-chain
- Cannot reverse attestation to personal data
- One person = one account (Civic enforces uniqueness)
- Attestation can be updated when technology changes

**Multi-Issuer Support:**
- Civic is the initial trusted issuer
- DAO can add more issuers (RNS.ID, Sumsub, etc.)
- Constitutional proposal required (75% supermajority)
- Protects against single issuer dependency

**Step 2: Receive Your Initial Claim (Retroactive UBI)**
- **Everyone:** Maximum 1 year back-payment (36,500 AGORA)
- **Same rule for children and adults**
- **Child Protection:** Under 18 have ~88% locked until adulthood

**Step 3: Claim Your Daily UBI**
- Receive 100 AGORA tokens per day
- Tokens accumulate automatically for up to 30 days
- Claim daily, weekly, or monthly - your choice

**Step 4: Use AGORA Directly**
- Pay merchants who accept AGORA
- Trade with other users
- Save for future needs
- Participate in AGORA economy

**No fiat involved. No exchanges necessary.**

## 4. The Sacred Promise: 100 AGORA Forever

### Why This Number Cannot Change

**100 AGORA per day is not a parameter. It is the IDENTITY of the protocol.**

Just as the speed of light defines physics, 100 AGORA/day defines AGORA. Change it, and you no longer have AGORA - you have something else entirely.

### The Danger of "Adjustable" UBI

Imagine if the daily amount could be changed by vote:

**Year 1:** "Let's increase to 150 AGORA/day to help adoption!"
- Sounds reasonable. Passes.

**Year 3:** "Inflation is too high, let's reduce to 50 AGORA/day."
- Economic arguments made. Passes.

**Year 5:** "Emergency! Let's temporarily set to 10 AGORA/day."
- Crisis justifies it. Passes.

**Year 10:** "Why not 0? The protocol has evolved beyond UBI."
- Mission drift complete. AGORA is dead.

**This is not hypothetical. This is how institutions decay.**

### Our Solution: Immutable Code

The 100 AGORA/day promise is **encoded in immutable smart contract code**.

After deployment:
- No DAO vote can change it
- No governance proposal can modify it
- No emergency can override it
- No upgrade can touch it

**The code that mints 100 AGORA/day is locked forever.**

This is not a limitation - it is a **guarantee**.

To every human, present and future:
> *"You will receive 100 AGORA per day. Not 99. Not 101. Not 'whatever the DAO decides.' Exactly 100, forever."*

## 5. Dual-Program Architecture

### The Challenge: Immutability vs. Adaptability

We face a fundamental tension:

**Need #1: Immutable Promise**
- 100 AGORA/day must never change
- Biometric verification must remain secure
- Core minting logic must be tamper-proof

**Need #2: Democratic Governance**
- Fee parameters may need adjustment
- Sanctions against bad actors
- Bug fixes in non-critical components
- New features as protocol evolves

**How do you have both?**

### The Solution: Two Separate Programs

AGORA is implemented as **two independent smart contracts** on Solana:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How They Communicate

**Critical principle:** Core READS from Governance, but Governance CANNOT MODIFY Core.

**Example: Country Sanctions**

1. DAO passes sanction proposal (67% supermajority required)
2. Governance creates `CountrySanction` account for that country
3. When user claims, Core READS the sanction account
4. Core applies reduction: `actual = 100 × sanction_percentage / 100`

```rust
// In AGORA CORE (immutable code)
let sanction_pct = match country_sanction_account {
    Some(sanction) => sanction.ubi_percentage,  // e.g., 25
    None => 100,  // No sanction = full 100%
};

let mint_amount = DAILY_AMOUNT * sanction_pct / 100;
// If sanctioned at 25%: mints 25 AGORA
// If no sanction: mints 100 AGORA
```

**What Governance CAN do:**
- Create/remove sanction accounts (reduce UBI to 1-99%)
- Adjust fee percentages
- Manage gas pool
- Upgrade its own code

**What Governance CANNOT do:**
- Change the 100 AGORA constant
- Modify Core's minting logic
- Override Core's biometric checks
- Call Core's internal functions

### Why This Separation Matters

**Scenario: Malicious DAO Takeover**

Imagine a hostile group gains 67% voting power:

**In a single-program design:**
- They upgrade the contract
- Change 100 to 0
- AGORA is destroyed

**In dual-program design:**
- They can upgrade Governance
- But Core is IMMUTABLE
- 100 AGORA/day continues forever
- They can at most impose sanctions (reduce to 1% minimum)
- Even then, some UBI always flows

**The sacred promise survives.**

### Sanctions: Power with Limits

Sanctions are the strongest tool Governance has over UBI distribution:

| Sanction Level | UBI Received | Example Use |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| No sanction | 100 AGORA | Normal citizens |
| 75% sanction | 75 AGORA | Minor violations |
| 50% sanction | 50 AGORA | Moderate violations |
| 25% sanction | 25 AGORA | Serious violations |
| 10% sanction | 10 AGORA | Severe violations |
| 1% sanction | 1 AGORA | Maximum penalty |

**Critical:** Sanctions can NEVER reduce to 0%. Even the worst actor receives 1 AGORA/day. This is a philosophical commitment: no human is completely excluded.

**Sanction requirements:**
- 67% supermajority vote
- 5% of users quorum
- 75,000 AGORA bond
- 14-day voting period

This makes sanctions rare and serious, not casual tools of exclusion.

### Biometric Future-Proofing

Technology changes. Today's fingerprint may be tomorrow's DNA hash.

**The `update_biometric` function in Core allows:**
1. User proves ownership of OLD biometric (live scan)
2. User provides NEW biometric hash (from updated eID)
3. System verifies NEW hash is unique
4. Old record invalidated, new record created

**Security:**
- Must have BOTH old AND new biometric
- Cannot "steal" someone's account
- Supports technology migration
- Part of immutable Core (always available)

---

## 6. AGORA as True Currency, Not Speculation

### The Vision: Circular Economies

AGORA is designed to be **spent**, not hoarded.

**The Goal:**
```
You earn AGORA → You spend at local merchant → Merchant pays suppliers → 
Suppliers pay workers → Workers spend at merchants → Circular economy
```

**Not:**
```
You earn AGORA → You sell for USD → You wait for "moon" → Speculation
```

### Why This Design Matters

**Activity-based fees discourage hoarding:**
- Active users (TX within 7 days): 0.04% fee
- Dormant users (no TX for 90+ days): 0.10% fee

**Merchant incentives encourage acceptance:**
- High-volume merchants: 0% fees
- Creates real places to spend AGORA

**No fiat on-ramps by design:**
- You cannot "buy" AGORA
- You can only earn it (through humanity or commerce)
- This prevents speculation from dominating

### The Parallel Economy

We're not trying to replace USD tomorrow.

We're building an **alternative** that can:
- Exist alongside fiat
- Serve communities ignored by traditional banking
- Provide stability when fiat fails
- Offer dignity without bureaucracy

**1 AGORA = 1 AGORA**

Its value is what you can DO with it, not what exchanges say.

---

## 7. Target Communities

### Who Benefits Most

**Local merchants and service providers:**
- Barbers, cafes, farmers markets
- Accept AGORA, keep customers in ecosystem
- Lower fees than credit cards
- No chargebacks

**Gig workers and informal economy:**
- No bank account needed
- Receive payment instantly
- Build transaction history
- Access to basic income

**Communities underserved by banking:**
- Rural areas without bank branches
- Immigrants without credit history
- Young people without established accounts
- Anyone excluded from traditional finance

**Developing economies:**
- Stable alternative to volatile local currency
- Access to global AGORA economy
- Protection from hyperinflation
- Dignity without foreign aid

---

## 8. Founder Compensation & Fair Launch

### Zero Pre-mine. Zero Special Treatment.

The founder receives exactly what everyone else receives:
- **100 AGORA per day**
- No pre-allocation
- No team tokens
- No investor rounds

### DAO-Determined Compensation

After Year 1, the DAO can vote to compensate ongoing development:

**Proposal requirements:**
- Treasury withdrawal proposal
- 50% approval threshold
- 5,000 vote quorum
- 7-day voting period
- 50,000 AGORA bond

If the community believes the founder deserves compensation, they vote for it.
If not, the founder continues earning 100 AGORA/day like everyone else.

**This is accountability.**

---

## 9. Economic Sustainability

### Fee Structure

**Base fee:** 0.05% on transfers

**Distribution:**
- 50% burned (deflationary pressure)
- 50% to treasury (operations)

**Activity multipliers:**
- Active users: 0.8x (0.04% effective)
- Normal users: 1.0x (0.05% effective)
- Inactive users: 1.5x (0.075% effective)
- Dormant users: 2.0x (0.10% effective)

**Merchant discounts:**
- Emerging merchants: 25% off
- Small merchants: 50% off
- Medium merchants: 75% off
- Large/Enterprise: FREE

### Gas Pool System

New users shouldn't need SOL to use AGORA.

**How it works:**
1. Sponsors contribute SOL to gas pool
2. New users get first 5 transactions/day subsidized
3. Sponsors receive tier benefits and recognition

**Sponsor tiers:**
- Bronze (1+ SOL): 10% fee discount
- Silver (10+ SOL): 20% fee discount
- Gold (100+ SOL): 40% fee discount
- Platinum (1,000+ SOL): 60% fee discount
- Diamond (10,000+ SOL): FREE fees

### Treasury Funding

**Rate:** 1/(π×e) ≈ 0.117% of each claim

For every 100 AGORA claimed, treasury receives ~0.117 AGORA.

**Mathematical elegance:** Using universal constants (π, e) rather than arbitrary percentages.

---

## 10. Inflation Model & Long-Term Stability

### Supply Growth

**Daily mint per user:** 100 AGORA
**Annual per user:** 36,500 AGORA

**Deflationary forces:**
- Transfer fees (0.05% base)
- 50% of fees burned
- Inactive accounts (claims expire after 30 days)

### Equilibrium

As user base grows, burn rate increases proportionally.

```
Mint rate = Users × 100/day
Burn rate = Transaction volume × fee rate × 50%
```

When transaction volume is high relative to users, burn exceeds mint = deflation.
When transaction volume is low, mint exceeds burn = inflation.

**Natural equilibrium emerges from usage patterns.**

---

## 11. Governance Structure

### DAO Powers (via AGORA Governance)

**What DAO controls:**
- Fee parameters
- Sanction proposals
- Treasury withdrawals
- Governance program upgrades
- Merchant thresholds
- Gas pool parameters
- **Trusted identity issuers** (add/remove Civic, RNS.ID, etc.)

**What DAO cannot touch:**
- 100 AGORA/day (immutable in Core)
- Attestation verification logic (reads from Governance)
- Core minting functions
- User registration process
- `update_attestation` function

### Proposal Types

Quorums are **dynamic** - calculated as percentage of total registered users:

| Type | Quorum | Approval | Bond | Voting Period |
|------|--------|----------|------|---------------|
| Standard | 1% of users | >50% | 20,000 AGORA | 3 days |
| Treasury | 2% of users | >50% | 50,000 AGORA | 7 days |
| Sanction | 5% of users | >67% | 75,000 AGORA | 14 days |
| Constitutional | 10% of users | >75% | 100,000 AGORA | 14 days |

**Why this order?** Changing the system (Constitutional) is more serious than sanctioning a country. System changes affect everyone forever; sanctions are reversible.

**Quorum minimum (no governance until 1M users):**
- Standard: 10,000 (1% of 1M)
- Treasury: 20,000 (2% of 1M)
- Sanction: 50,000 (5% of 1M)
- Constitutional: 100,000 (10% of 1M)

**No maximum cap** - democracy scales infinitely. At 100M users, Constitutional needs 10M votes.

**Example at 10 million users:**
- Standard: 100,000 votes needed
- Treasury: 200,000 votes needed
- Sanction: 500,000 votes needed
- Constitutional: 1,000,000 votes needed with 75% approval

### Reputation System

**Automatic, based on proposal outcomes:**
- Proposal passes: +2 reputation
- Proposal rejected (with quorum): +1 reputation
- Low quorum (50%+): -1 reputation
- Very low quorum (25-50%): -2 reputation
- Spam (under 25%): -3 reputation

**At -10 reputation:** Banned from creating proposals.

**No manual flagging.** System is manipulation-resistant.

## 13. FAQ Essentials

### The Sacred Promise

**Q: Can the 100 AGORA/day ever be changed?**
A: No. The code is immutable. After deployment, upgrade authority is permanently revoked. No DAO vote, no emergency, no governance can modify it.

**Q: What if there's a bug in Core?**
A: Core is minimal and heavily audited. If a critical bug is found, we deploy a new immutable Core and migrate users. The old Core remains unchanged (broken but immutable). This is the price of true immutability.

**Q: Why not make everything immutable?**
A: Because protocol needs to adapt. Fee parameters, sanctions, new features - these require flexibility. Only the sacred promise (100 AGORA/day) is immutable.

### Sanctions

**Q: Can DAO sanction anyone to 0 AGORA?**
A: No. Minimum is always 1%. Even the worst actor receives 1 AGORA/day. No one is completely excluded.

**Q: What prevents abuse of sanctions?**
A: 67% supermajority, 5% of users quorum, 75,000 AGORA bond, 14-day voting period. Sanctions are rare and serious.

### Identity & Attestations

**Q: What if verification technology changes?**
A: The `update_attestation` function allows migration. Get a new attestation from any trusted issuer, call update, and your account is preserved with all history intact. Part of immutable Core.

**Q: Can someone steal my account?**
A: They would need to control your wallet AND get an attestation linked to your wallet. The attestation must pass Civic's biometric verification, which requires your face. Practically impossible.

**Q: What if Civic goes out of business?**
A: DAO can add new trusted issuers via Constitutional proposal (75% supermajority). RNS.ID, Sumsub, and others can be added. Users can then get attestations from any active issuer.

**Q: What if an issuer is compromised?**
A: DAO can remove the issuer via Constitutional proposal. Existing attestations remain valid until they expire. Users should update to attestations from active issuers.

### Economics

**Q: Won't AGORA have infinite inflation?**
A: Burn rate offsets minting. As usage grows, equilibrium emerges.

**Q: What gives AGORA value?**
A: What you can DO with it. As merchants accept AGORA, utility increases.

**Q: Why not peg to USD?**
A: That defeats the purpose. We're building an ALTERNATIVE, not a derivative.

## Conclusion

### What We're Building

**Not another speculative token.**
**Not another DeFi protocol.**
**Not another promise that can be broken.**

We're building **economic freedom encoded in immutable code.**

- 100 AGORA per day, forever
- For every human
- Controlled by no one
- Changeable by no one

### The Dual Promise

### The Invitation

We're not selling anything.
We're not promising returns.
We're not asking for investment.

**We're inviting you to participate in an experiment:**

Can we build money that truly serves everyone?
Can we encode promises that cannot be broken?
Can we create economic freedom through technology?

**Let's find out together.**

**For economic freedom.**
**For everyone.**
**Forever.**
