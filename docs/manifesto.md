# AGORA Protocol - Manifesto
## Money for Economic Freedom: Breaking the Chains of Centralized Control

**Version 1.1 (with Inflation Model)**  
**November 2025**

---

## Abstract

**AGORA Protocol is a tool for economic freedom.**

This is money that is not tied to fiat currencies. Not dependent on exchanges. Not controlled by central institutions that manipulate it for their benefit.

This is money created directly by people, for people, outside the grasp of those who have monopolized wealth creation.

**AGORA is Bitcoin's philosophy applied to Universal Basic Income.**

## 1. The Problem: Centralized Money Creation

### The System is Broken

Money today is created centrally - by those who already have too much of it.

**The wealthy control:**
- Central banks that print money at will
- Commercial banks that create money through lending
- Investment funds that manipulate markets
- Corporations that lobby for favorable policies

**The result:**
- Money flows **upward** to asset owners
- Real wages **stagnate** for workers
- Housing becomes **unaffordable**
- Financial security becomes a **privilege**, not a right

### The Illusion of Trickle-Down

We're told to be grateful for "crumbs" - minimum wage increases, welfare programs, stimulus checks.

Meanwhile, those at the top:
- Buy more properties
- Accumulate more stocks
- Increase their political influence
- Use their wealth to extract more wealth

**This must end.**

### Why Traditional Solutions Fail

**Government welfare:**
- Bureaucratic and degrading
- Conditional and controlling
- Subject to political whims
- Often cut during economic crises (when most needed)

**Charity:**
- Insufficient and unpredictable
- Creates dependency
- Doesn't address systemic issues
- Allows the wealthy to control narratives

**Job market:**
- Automation replaces human labor
- Wages don't match productivity gains
- "Full employment" often means multiple jobs to survive
- Power imbalance favors employers

**We need a different approach.**

## 2. Why Bitcoin's Solution Isn't Enough

### Bitcoin's Revolutionary Insight

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto solved the fundamental problem of digital money:

> *"What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust."*

Bitcoin showed that **money doesn't need central banks.**

**Bitcoin's achievements:**
- Decentralized creation
- Fixed supply (21M cap)
- Censorship-resistant
- Trustless verification
- Borderless transfers

### But Bitcoin Has Limitations

**1. Centralization Through Wealth**

The more money you have, the more:
- Mining equipment you can buy
- Hash power you control
- Bitcoin you can accumulate
- Influence you wield

**Result:** Bitcoin mining is dominated by large corporations. The dream of "one CPU, one vote" is dead.

**2. Tied to Fiat System**

To get Bitcoin, most people must:
- Buy it with fiat currency
- Through centralized exchanges
- Subject to KYC/AML regulations
- At prices determined by speculative trading

**Result:** Bitcoin remains **entangled with the very system it sought to replace.**

**3. Speculation Over Usage**

Bitcoin's "store of value" narrative:
- Encourages hoarding, not spending
- Creates volatile price swings
- Makes it impractical as daily currency
- Benefits early adopters at expense of latecomers

**Result:** Bitcoin became digital gold - an investment vehicle, not a medium of exchange.

### The Core Problem

**You can't escape fiat by using fiat to enter crypto.**

As long as access requires existing wealth:
- The wealth gap persists
- Central institutions maintain control
- Economic freedom remains elusive
- Power structures don't change

**We need money that's accessible to everyone, regardless of current wealth.**

---

## 3. AGORA Solution: The Core Mechanism

### The Simple Version (Hook)

Every verified human receives **100 AGORA tokens per day**.

**Plus: Join early and get up to 1 year of back-payment instantly.**

- No mining equipment needed
- No capital investment required
- No exchanges to navigate
- No speculation necessary

**Just proof that you're a unique human being.**

### How It Works

**Step 1: Verify Your Humanity**
- Use government-issued digital certificate (eIDAS, digital passport)
- Or other proof-of-personhood methods (added progressively)
- One person = one account (cryptographically enforced)
- Privacy-preserving (we store only cryptographic hashes, never raw identity data)

**Step 2: Receive Your Initial Claim (Retroactive UBI)**
- **Babies (0-364 days old):** Proportional to age
  - Example: 6-month-old (180 days) receives 18,000 AGORA initial claim
  - Formula: age_in_days × 100 AGORA
- **Adults (≥365 days old):** Full 1-year back-payment
  - Everyone gets 36,500 AGORA initial claim
  - Fair for all ages 1 year and older
- **Child Protection:** All initial claims for users under 18 are locked until adulthood
  - Parents can access guardian allowance for child's needs
  - Full balance unlocks automatically at age 18

**Step 3: Claim Your Daily UBI**
- Receive 100 AGORA tokens per day
- Tokens accumulate automatically for up to 30 days
- Claim daily, weekly, or monthly - your choice
- Flexible and convenient

**Step 4: Use AGORA Directly**
- Pay merchants who accept AGORA
- Trade with other users
- Save for future needs
- Participate in AGORA economy

**No fiat involved. No exchanges necessary.**

### The Retroactive Model: Rewarding Early Adoption

**Why retroactive payments?**

AGORA doesn't exist yet, but your life does. The retroactive model compensates early adopters for the time before AGORA existed - up to 1 year of "back-pay."

**How it works:**
```
Newborn (1 day old):     100 AGORA initial
3-month-old (90 days):   9,000 AGORA initial
6-month-old (180 days):  18,000 AGORA initial
1-year-old (365 days):   36,500 AGORA initial
5-year-old:              36,500 AGORA initial
Adult:                   36,500 AGORA initial

Plus: 100 AGORA/day ongoing for everyone
```

**Key benefits:**
- ✅ Fair for all ages (proportional for babies, equal for adults)
- ✅ Strong incentive to join early
- ✅ Age-neutral for everyone ≥1 year old
- ✅ Protects children's wealth until age 18
- ✅ Manageable economic impact (not infinite back-pay)

### The 30-Day Accumulation Window

**Flexible claiming:**
- Tokens accumulate automatically (100 per day)
- Claim daily, weekly, or monthly - your choice
- Maximum 30 days of accumulation (3,000 AGORA)
- Older unclaimed tokens expire (rolling window)

**Why this matters:**
- Accessible to people without daily internet access
- Lower transaction costs (claim once per month vs. 30 times)
- Predictable supply (prevents infinite accumulation)
- Fair system (use it or lose it)

**Example:**
```
Week 1: Claim 700 AGORA (7 days)
Week 2: Claim 700 AGORA
Week 3: Claim 700 AGORA
Week 4: Claim 700 AGORA

Total: 2,800 AGORA/month with only 4 transactions
```

### Breaking Free from Fiat

**Traditional UBI:** Government prints money → Distributes → Inflation erodes value → Back to dependency

**AGORA UBI:** 
- Blockchain creates tokens → Direct distribution → Value determined by actual usage
- No government intermediary
- No central bank manipulation
- No fiat currency involved

**This is fundamental freedom.**

---

## 4. AGORA as True Currency, Not Speculation

### The Philosophy: 1 AGORA = 1 AGORA

Just as Bitcoin believers say "1 BTC = 1 BTC", we say:

**"1 AGORA = 1 AGORA"**

**What this means:**
- AGORA's value is what you can DO with it, not what you can sell it for
- Success is measured in merchant adoption, not USD price
- Growth comes from real transactions, not speculation
- Stability comes from circular economy, not price pegging

### The Problem with Fiat Comparison

**Don't think:** "1 AGORA = $0.10"

**Think instead:** 
- "1 haircut = 500 AGORA"
- "1 hour of tutoring = 300 AGORA"
- "1 kg of tomatoes = 50 AGORA"

**When you measure AGORA in dollars, you're still trapped in the fiat mindset.**

### Building Circular Economies

**The goal is NOT:**
```
Earn AGORA → Sell for EUR → Buy goods with EUR ❌
```

**The goal IS:**
```
Earn AGORA → Spend AGORA → Receive AGORA → Repeat
```

**Example circular economy:**
```
Farmer grows vegetables → Sells for AGORA
Hairdresser cuts farmer's hair → Accepts AGORA
Mechanic fixes hairdresser's car → Accepts AGORA
Farmer buys car parts → Pays in AGORA

Money circulates within the community.
No fiat involved. No extraction.
```

### Why This Works

**1. Central Bank Independence**
- No institution can print AGORA at will
- No monetary policy manipulation
- No inflation through quantitative easing
- Distribution is algorithmic and fair

**2. Immune to Traditional Financial Crises**
- No connection to bank solvency
- No risk of "bank runs"
- No exposure to government debt
- Continues functioning regardless of fiat chaos

**3. True Economic Alternative**
- Parallel economy alongside traditional money
- Gradually grows as adoption increases
- Doesn't require permission from authorities
- Can't be "shut down" by any single entity

### Bitcoin vs. AGORA: Key Difference

**Bitcoin:**
- Scarce by design (21M cap)
- Distributed by computational power (mining)
- Early adopters benefit most
- Requires capital to acquire

**AGORA:**
- Abundant by design (100 per person per day)
- Distributed by personhood (verification)
- Everyone has equal daily access
- Requires only proof of humanity

**Both are immune to centralized control. But AGORA provides universal access.**

---

## 5. Target Communities

### Who Is AGORA For?

**Primary target: Productive communities who:**
- Already work outside traditional banking
- Use cash for most transactions
- Understand value of direct exchange
- Want alternatives to fiat currency

### Target Groups

**1. Local Merchants & Service Providers**
- Hairdressers, barbers, beauticians
- Mechanics, handymen, repairpeople
- Small restaurant owners, food stands
- Local artisans, craftspeople
- Tutors, trainers, coaches

**Why them:**
- Used to cash transactions
- Understand direct value exchange
- Can immediately accept AGORA
- Natural network effects (serve local community)

**2. Farmers & Food Producers**
- Small-scale farmers
- Market vendors
- Community-supported agriculture (CSA)
- Local food cooperatives

**Why them:**
- Produce essential goods people need daily
- Often operate on thin margins with fiat
- Strong community connections
- Tangible value everyone recognizes

**3. Informal Economy Workers**
- Freelancers and gig workers
- Street vendors
- Domestic workers
- Day laborers

**Why them:**
- Already outside traditional financial system
- Need reliable income alternatives
- High transaction costs with fiat
- Value financial privacy

**4. Rural & Developing Communities**
- Areas with limited banking infrastructure
- Communities with high remittance costs
- Regions with unstable local currencies
- Places where cash is still king

**Why them:**
- Less entrenched in fiat system
- Strong local trust networks
- Need for alternative financial tools
- High potential for circular economies

### What We're NOT Targeting (Initially)

**NOT:** Tech-savvy crypto investors looking for 100x gains  
**NOT:** People who only want to trade on DEXs  
**NOT:** Those seeking passive investment income  
**NOT:** Wealthy individuals diversifying portfolios

**These people can use AGORA, but they're not the primary beneficiaries.**

### The Expansion Strategy

**Phase 1 (Year 1):** 
- Focus on 3-5 local communities
- Deep integration (10-20 merchants minimum)
- Prove the circular economy model
- Document success stories

**Phase 2 (Year 2):**
- Expand to 10-20 communities
- Build merchant tools and training
- Create AGORA-native businesses
- Strengthen network effects

**Phase 3 (Year 3+):**
- Scale to 100+ communities
- Cross-community commerce
- AGORA-denominated loans/savings
- Full parallel economy functioning

## 6. Founder Compensation & Fair Launch

### The Principle: Zero Pre-mine

**AGORA has:**
- 0% founder pre-mine
- 0% team allocation
- 0% investor allocation
- 100% public distribution

**Every single AGORA token is created through daily UBI claims.**

### Why This Matters

**Most crypto projects:**
```
Founders: 20%
Team: 15%
Investors: 30%
Public: 35%

Result: Insiders control majority, can dump on public
```

**AGORA:**
```
Founders: 0%
Team: 0%
Investors: 0%
Public: 100%

Result: No insider advantage, maximum legitimacy
```

### How the Founder Gets Compensated

**The founder claims UBI just like everyone else:**
- 100 AGORA per day
- Same rules as everyone
- No special privileges
- No backdoor minting

**Additional compensation ONLY if the DAO votes to pay:**

```rust
DAO Proposal Example:
"Compensate founder for Year 1 development work:
 - Amount: 1,000,000 AGORA (equivalent to ~27 years of UBI)
 - Reason: Built protocol, managed launch, ongoing development
 - Vesting: 4 years, 25% per year
 - Voting threshold: 66% yes votes required"
```

**If the community says NO → founder receives nothing beyond daily UBI.**

### Why This Is Radical

**Traditional startups:** Founders take equity upfront, guaranteed ownership regardless of success.

**AGORA:** Founder bets on:
1. Project succeeding (UBI tokens having value)
2. Community appreciating the work (voting compensation)
3. Long-term sustainability (not quick exit)

**This aligns incentives perfectly:**
- Founder wants AGORA to succeed (otherwise daily 100 tokens are worthless)
- Founder must serve community (or they vote NO on compensation)
- No "pump and dump" possible (no tokens to dump!)

### Transparency

All founder activity is public:
- GitHub commits
- DAO proposals
- Compensation votes
- Token holdings visible on-chain

**No hidden allocations. No surprise dumps. No rug pulls.**

### Fair Launch Comparison

| Project | Founder Allocation | Can Founder Dump? | Exit Scam Risk |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Typical ICO | 20-40% | Yes | High |
| Typical DeFi | 10-30% | Yes | Medium |
| Bitcoin | 0%* | No** | None |
| AGORA | 0% | No | None |

*Satoshi mined early but never sold  
**Satoshi's coins are presumed lost/inaccessible

**AGORA matches Bitcoin's legitimacy standard.**

---

## 7. Economic Sustainability

### The Challenge

**Daily minting rate:**
- 100 AGORA per user per day
- 1 million users = 100M AGORA/day
- 36.5B AGORA/year

**Without controls, this causes inflation.**

### But Wait - Is It Really Inflation?

**Traditional inflation:** Central bank prints money → Currency loses purchasing power vs. goods

**AGORA "inflation":** 
- Only happens if you measure AGORA in fiat (which we shouldn't)
- In circular economies, more participants = more value
- Metcalfe's Law: Network value grows faster than user count

**Example:**
```
100 users, 10,000 AGORA total:
- Limited goods/services available
- Hard to find AGORA acceptors

1M users, 36B AGORA total:
- Rich marketplace of goods/services
- Easy to spend AGORA everywhere
- Each AGORA more useful, not less
```

**However, we still need supply controls for market stability.**

### Dynamic Burn Rate (Personalized PI Controller)

Instead of fixed burn rates, AGORA uses **personalized transaction fees** based on behavior:

```rust
pub fn calculate_transfer_fee(user: &UserAccount, amount: u64) -> u64 {
    let base_fee_bps = 10; // 0.1% base (10 basis points)
    
    // Behavioral multiplier
    let mut multiplier = 1.0;
    
    // Reward spenders (trust in AGORA)
    if user.spending_frequency > HIGH_THRESHOLD {
        multiplier *= 0.8; // 20% discount
    }
    
    // Penalize hoarders (extractive behavior)
    if user.hoarding_score > HIGH_THRESHOLD {
        multiplier *= 1.5; // 50% premium
    }
    
    // Reward merchants (ecosystem builders)
    if user.is_verified_merchant {
        multiplier *= 0.5; // 50% discount
    }
    
    let adjusted_fee_bps = (base_fee_bps as f64 * multiplier) as u16;
    
    // Calculate actual fee
    (amount * adjusted_fee_bps) / 10000
}
```

**Fee distribution:**
- 50% permanently burned (deflationary pressure)
- 50% to protocol treasury (development, operations)

### How This Creates Balance

**Active user (spends regularly):**
```
Transfer 1,000 AGORA:
Base fee: 1 AGORA (0.1%)
Multiplier: 0.8 (spending bonus)
Actual fee: 0.8 AGORA
Burned: 0.4 AGORA
```

**Hoarder (rarely spends):**
```
Transfer 1,000 AGORA:
Base fee: 1 AGORA (0.1%)
Multiplier: 1.5 (hoarding penalty)
Actual fee: 1.5 AGORA
Burned: 0.75 AGORA
```

**Merchant (ecosystem builder):**
```
Transfer 1,000 AGORA:
Base fee: 1 AGORA (0.1%)
Multiplier: 0.5 (merchant discount)
Actual fee: 0.5 AGORA
Burned: 0.25 AGORA
```

### Why Personalized Fees Are Fair

**Traditional burn rate:** Everyone pays the same percentage regardless of behavior.
- Problem: Penalizes active participants who use AGORA as currency
- Result: Reduces incentive to spend, increases hoarding

**Personalized burn rate:** Fee reflects your contribution to the ecosystem.
- If you spend → Low fees (you're helping circulation)
- If you hoard → High fees (you're extracting value)
- If you're a merchant → Lowest fees (you're building economy)

**This creates positive feedback loop:**
```
More spending → More merchant adoption → More goods available → 
More AGORA utility → More spending → [repeat]
```

### Equilibrium Mechanism

**The system self-stabilizes:**

1. **Too much hoarding** → High burn fees on hoarders → Supply decreases → Value per token increases → Incentive to spend returns

2. **Too much spending** → Low burn fees overall → Supply increases → More tokens circulating → Economy expands

3. **Balanced behavior** → Moderate burn rate → Sustainable growth → Stable circular economy

### Global vs. Personal Burn Rate

**Why not just adjust global burn rate?**

**Problem with global adjustment:**
```
If global burn = 5%:
- Active merchant transferring 100k AGORA/month → loses 5,000 AGORA
- Hoarder transferring 1k AGORA/year → loses 50 AGORA

Result: Merchants subsidize hoarders (unfair!)
```

**Solution with personalized fees:**
```
Merchant (0.05% effective fee):
- Transfers 100k AGORA/month → loses 50 AGORA
- Building ecosystem → rewarded with low fees

Hoarder (0.15% effective fee):
- Transfers 1k AGORA/year → loses 1.5 AGORA
- Extractive behavior → penalized with higher fees

Result: Fair distribution of costs!
```

### Economic Philosophy

**We don't want:**
- Speculation on AGORA price
- Hoarding for investment returns
- "HODL" mentality from Bitcoin culture

**We want:**
- Active circulation
- Real economic activity
- Merchant adoption
- Goods and services exchanged

**The personalized burn rate encourages the behavior we want and discourages what we don't.**

### Long-term Sustainability

**As AGORA grows:**

**Phase 1 (0-10k users):**
- Low transaction volume
- Minimal burn
- Focus on adoption
- Fees can be lower

**Phase 2 (10k-100k users):**
- Increasing transactions
- Burn rate ramps up
- Merchant networks forming
- Ecosystem developing

**Phase 3 (100k-1M users):**
- High transaction volume
- Significant burn offsetting mint
- Mature circular economies
- Self-sustaining system

**Phase 4 (1M+ users):**
- Burn rate ≈ Mint rate (equilibrium)
- Stable token supply
- Parallel economy functioning
- No fiat dependency

**The system is designed to reach equilibrium automatically through behavioral incentives.**

## 8. Inflation Model & Long-Term Stability

### Understanding AGORA Inflation: A Different Paradigm

#### Definitions & Framework

Before discussing inflation in AGORA, we must establish clear definitions:

**Token Supply Inflation:** The annual percentage increase in total AGORA tokens in circulation.
- Formula: `(New Tokens Minted / Total Supply) × 100`
- This is mechanical and predictable

**Purchasing Power Impact:** How supply inflation affects what you can buy with AGORA.
- In fiat: More money printing → Less purchasing power
- In AGORA: More users → More value (Metcalfe's Law)

**Key Distinction:** AGORA inflation is NOT the same as fiat inflation because:
1. **Democratic Distribution:** New tokens go to all verified humans equally, not to banks
2. **Network Effects:** More users increase utility, potentially offsetting supply dilution
3. **Circular Economy:** Value stays within the system instead of leaking to speculators

### Core Assumptions of Our Model

1. **User Adoption:** S-curve growth reaching 822M users by year 20
   - Based on smartphone and internet adoption patterns
   - Conservative compared to global population

2. **Retroactive Claims:** 99% of adults claim full 36,500 AGORA bonus
   - Strong incentive for early adoption
   - One-time impact that decreases over time

3. **Burn Rate:** 0.05% base transaction fee (50% burned, 50% to treasury)
   - Personalized rates (0.025% - 0.15%) based on behavior
   - Increases with economic activity

4. **Economic Velocity:** Money velocity increases as ecosystem matures
   - More transactions = More burning
   - Natural deflationary pressure over time

### The Inflation Model

AGORA uses a **declining inflation rate model** that naturally reaches equilibrium:

#### Phase 1: Launch Period (Years 0-2)
- **Inflation: High but irrelevant**
- Initial distribution phase
- Retroactive claims dominate supply
- Network bootstrapping

#### Phase 2: Growth Phase (Years 3-10)
- **Year 5: 23.5% inflation**
- **Year 10: 12.6% inflation**
- Retroactive impact declining (from 50.7% to 11.3% of supply)
- User growth drives regular minting
- Burn mechanisms begin to matter

#### Phase 3: Maturation (Years 11-20)
- **Year 15: 8.6% inflation**
- **Year 20: 6.4% inflation**
- Retroactive claims negligible (<7% of supply)
- Burn rate approaches minting rate
- System finding natural equilibrium

#### Phase 4: Steady State (Years 21-30+)
- **Year 25: ~5% inflation (projected)**
- **Year 30: ~4% inflation (projected)**
- User growth slows (market saturation)
- Burn rate potentially exceeds minting
- **Possible deflation if economic activity high enough**

### 30-Year Inflation Projection

```
Year  | Total Supply | Annual Inflation | Retroactive % | Notes
------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------
1     | 26.2T       | N/A             | 50.7%         | Bootstrap
5     | 91.2T       | 23.5%           | 18.8%         | High growth
10    | 194.8T      | 12.6%           | 11.3%         | Stabilizing
15    | 321.4T      | 8.6%            | 8.2%          | Maturing
20    | 466.8T      | 6.4%            | 6.4%          | Near equilibrium
25    | 640T*       | ~5%*            | ~5%*          | Projected
30    | 820T*       | ~4%*            | ~4%*          | Steady state

*Projections based on model extrapolation
```

### Why This Inflation Is Sustainable

#### 1. **It's Predictable**
Unlike fiat currencies where central banks change policy arbitrarily, AGORA's inflation follows a mathematical model. Everyone knows exactly how many tokens will exist.

#### 2. **It Benefits Users, Not Elites**
Every new token goes to a real person, not to banks for lending or governments for spending. This is inflation that directly supports people.

#### 3. **It Decreases Over Time**
As the base grows, fixed daily minting (100 AGORA/person/day) becomes a smaller percentage of total supply. Natural mathematical deceleration.

#### 4. **Burn Mechanisms Create Equilibrium**
The personalized burn rate means:
- Active users (spenders) pay less → Encourages circulation
- Hoarders pay more → Discourages speculation
- Merchants pay least → Builds ecosystem

At some point, burning equals or exceeds minting, creating **steady state or deflation**.

#### 5. **Network Value Grows Faster Than Supply**
Metcalfe's Law: Network value ∝ n²  
Token supply growth: Linear (n)  
**Result:** Per-token value can increase despite inflation

### Comparison with Traditional Systems

| Aspect | Fiat Currency | Bitcoin | AGORA |
|--------|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Inflation Rate** | 2-10%+ (variable) | ~1.7% (decreasing) | 23.5%→4% (30 years) |
| **Who Gets New Money** | Banks & Government | Miners | Every Human Equally |
| **Predictability** | Policy changes | Fixed schedule | Fixed schedule |
| **Burn Mechanism** | None | Transaction fees | Personalized burn |
| **Long-term Trend** | Perpetual inflation | Deflationary | Equilibrium/Deflationary |

### Real-World Impact on Users

**Year 1 User:**
- Receives: 36,500 AGORA (retroactive) + 36,500 AGORA (daily)
- Total: 73,000 AGORA
- Inflation impact: Minimal (early adopter advantage)

**Year 10 User:**
- Receives: 36,500 AGORA (retroactive) + 36,500 AGORA (daily)
- Annual inflation: 12.6%
- **Key insight:** Daily income (36,500) far exceeds inflation loss on holdings

**Year 20 User:**
- Receives: 36,500 AGORA (retroactive) + 36,500 AGORA (daily)
- Annual inflation: 6.4%
- Mature ecosystem with widespread acceptance

### The Inflation Paradox

**Traditional thinking:** "High inflation = bad"

**AGORA reality:**
- You receive 36,500 new tokens yearly
- Inflation only affects tokens you're holding
- If you spend regularly (as intended), inflation barely impacts you
- If you hoard, personalized fees impact you more than inflation

**Example calculation:**
- You hold: 10,000 AGORA
- Year 10 inflation: 12.6%
- "Loss" to inflation: 1,260 AGORA value
- Your annual UBI: 36,500 AGORA
- **Net gain: 35,240 AGORA value**

### Safeguards Against Hyperinflation

1. **Hard Cap on Daily Minting:** 100 AGORA/person/day cannot be changed without DAO supermajority

2. **Identity Verification:** Prevents Sybil attacks (fake accounts) that could inflate supply

3. **Burn Rate Adjustment:** DAO can vote to increase burn rates if inflation exceeds targets

4. **Natural Limits:** Earth's population provides natural cap (~10B maximum users)

5. **Economic Incentives:** High inflation → More burning activity → Deflationary pressure

### Conclusion: Inflation as a Feature, Not a Bug

AGORA's inflation model is fundamentally different from fiat inflation:

- **It's fair:** Everyone gets the same amount
- **It's transparent:** No hidden money printing
- **It's sustainable:** Decreases over time toward equilibrium
- **It's beneficial:** Funds universal basic income without taxation
- **It's controllable:** Burn mechanisms and DAO governance provide tools

The question isn't "How do we eliminate inflation?" but rather **"How do we use inflation to create economic freedom for all?"**

AGORA answers: By making inflation work for people, not against them.

## 10. Economics

### Token Supply

**No pre-mine. No ICO. No founder allocation. No team allocation. No investor allocation.**

**100% fair launch. Public owns 100% of supply.**

**Minting:**
- Every verified human: 100 AGORA/day
- Automatic accumulation (30-day window)
- Claim daily, weekly, or monthly

**Supply projections:**
```
Year 1 (10k users):    365M AGORA
Year 2 (100k users):   3.65B AGORA
Year 3 (500k users):   18.25B AGORA
Year 5 (2M users):     73B AGORA
```

### Deflationary Mechanisms

**1. Personalized Transfer Fees**
- Base: 0.1% (10 basis points)
- Range: 0.05% - 0.15% based on behavior
- 50% burned, 50% to treasury

**2. Behavioral Incentives**
- Spenders: Lower fees (0.05%)
- Merchants: Lowest fees (0.05%)
- Hoarders: Higher fees (0.15%)

**3. Equilibrium Target**
```
At maturity:
Mint rate ≈ Burn rate
Supply stabilizes naturally
```

### Value Accrual

**AGORA gains value through:**

1. **Network effects** - More users = more utility
2. **Merchant adoption** - More places to spend
3. **Circular economies** - Money keeps circulating
4. **Scarcity through use** - Burn reduces supply
5. **Independence from fiat** - No reliance on exchanges

**NOT through:**
- Speculation
- Scarcity alone
- Price manipulation
- Pump and dump schemes

### Comparison: AGORA vs. Traditional Money

| Aspect | Fiat Currency | AGORA |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Creation** | Central bank (opaque) | Algorithm (transparent) |
| **Distribution** | Through loans, wages | Direct to people |
| **Supply control** | Political decisions | Automatic (burn rate) |
| **Access** | Requires bank account | Requires only proof of personhood |
| **Stability** | Government backing | Network effects + usage |
| **Inflation** | Hidden via money printing | Visible on-chain |
| **Manipulation** | Possible by institutions | Impossible (algorithmic) |

## 11. FAQ (Essentials)

### General

**Q: Is AGORA a cryptocurrency?**  
A: Yes, but not a speculative one. It's designed to be used as currency, not held as investment.

**Q: How is it different from Bitcoin?**  
A: Bitcoin is scarce and requires mining/buying. AGORA is abundant and distributed to all humans equally.

**Q: Do I need technical knowledge?**  
A: No. If you can use a website and verify your identity, you can use AGORA.

**Q: Is it legal?**  
A: AGORA is a neutral technology. Using it to transact is legal in most jurisdictions (check local laws).

---

### Identity & Privacy

**Q: How do you prevent fake accounts?**  
A: Government digital certificates (eIDAS, etc.) prove you're a unique person. Your real identity is never stored - only a cryptographic hash.

**Q: Is my identity public?**  
A: No. We store only a hash (irreversible mathematical fingerprint) of your ID. No one can know who you are from the hash.

**Q: What if I don't have a government digital ID?**  
A: Initially, AGORA requires eIDAS (EU). We'll add other identity providers over time (biometric, social graph, etc.).

**Q: Can the government track my AGORA transactions?**  
A: Transactions are public on the blockchain (like Bitcoin), but not linked to your real identity - only to your wallet address.

---

### Economics

**Q: Won't AGORA have infinite inflation?**  
A: No. The personalized burn rate offsets minting. As usage grows, burn increases until equilibrium is reached.

**Q: What gives AGORA value?**  
A: Same as any currency: what you can DO with it. As more merchants accept AGORA, its utility (and value) increases.

**Q: Why not peg it to USD or EUR?**  
A: That defeats the purpose. We're building an ALTERNATIVE to fiat, not another derivative of it. 1 AGORA = 1 AGORA.

**Q: What if everyone sells AGORA for fiat immediately?**  
A: Then AGORA fails. But if we build real circular economies where you can buy daily goods with AGORA, there's no reason to sell.

---

### Technical

**Q: Why Solana?**  
A: High throughput (65k+ TPS), low fees ($0.00025), fast finality (1-2 sec). Perfect for daily microtransactions.

**Q: Can AGORA be hacked?**  
A: Smart contracts will be audited. Solana itself has never been hacked (though it's had outages). No system is 100% secure, but we take security seriously.

**Q: What if Solana goes down?**  
A: AGORA can eventually be deployed on multiple chains (Ethereum L2s, SUI, etc.). The design is blockchain-agnostic.

**Q: Who controls the smart contracts?**  
A: Initially, a multi-sig guardian council (5 of 9). After Year 1, full control transitions to DAO governance.

---

### Participation

**Q: How do I join?**  
A: After mainnet launch:
1. Get a Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare)
2. Visit agora-protocol.org
3. Verify your identity (eIDAS)
4. Claim your first 100 AGORA
5. Find local merchants who accept AGORA

**Q: Can I become a merchant?**  
A: Yes! Register as merchant, get QR code for payments, enjoy lower transaction fees (0.05% vs. standard 0.1%).

**Q: How can I help?**  
A: Many ways:
- Spread the word
- Become a merchant
- Contribute code (GitHub)
- Join Discord community
- Vote in DAO governance
- Propose improvements

**Q: Is there a whitelist or pre-sale?**  
A: No. 100% fair launch. Everyone starts equal.

---

### Philosophy

**Q: Isn't this just another crypto scam?**  
A: We have zero pre-mine, zero founder allocation. The founder earns the same 100 AGORA/day as everyone else. There's nothing to "dump." Success requires genuine adoption, not hype.

**Q: Why should I trust you?**  
A: Don't trust. Verify. All code is open source. All transactions are on-chain. Founder is anonymous (can't be coerced). DAO controls everything after Year 1.

**Q: What if this fails?**  
A: Then we tried and learned. But the technology is sound, the need is real, and the vision is compelling. We think we'll succeed.

**Q: Why are you doing this?**  
A: Because centralized money creation is fundamentally unjust. Because everyone deserves economic freedom. Because we can build better systems.

## Conclusion

### The Vision

We're not building another speculative crypto token.

We're not promising "100x gains" or "moon."

We're not targeting the already-wealthy.

**We're building economic freedom.**

- Freedom from central banks
- Freedom from inflation manipulation
- Freedom from wage slavery
- Freedom from financial gatekeeping

**We're creating alternatives:**

- Alternative to fiat currency
- Alternative to traditional banking
- Alternative to employment-or-starve economy
- Alternative to speculative crypto markets

**We're enabling communities:**

- Local circular economies
- Merchant networks independent of fiat
- Direct person-to-person transactions
- Resilience against financial crises

### The Reality

**This will not be easy.**

Building new economic systems never is.

- Most people won't understand (at first)
- Regulators will be skeptical (or hostile)
- Critics will call it impossible (or scam)
- Progress will be slow (and frustrating)

**But here's what we know:**

- The current system is broken
- People want alternatives
- Technology makes this possible
- Someone has to try

**Why not us? Why not now?**

### The Invitation

**We're not selling you anything.**

- No ICO to buy into
- No tokens to purchase
- No investment opportunity
- No pump and dump

**We're inviting you to build with us:**

- Claim your daily 100 AGORA
- Accept AGORA in your business
- Trade directly with others
- Create circular economy
- Prove fiat isn't necessary

**This only works if we build it together.**

One person claiming tokens does nothing.  
One million people creating parallel economies changes everything.

### The Challenge

**Bitcoin freed money from banks.**  
**AGORA will create alternatives to fiat economies.**

**Not because we hate institutions.**  
**But because we believe in people.**

**Not because we promise utopia.**  
**But because we're building options.**

**This might succeed. It might fail.**  
**But we will try.**  
**And we invite you to join us.**

**For economic freedom.**  
**For everyone.**  
**Forever.**
